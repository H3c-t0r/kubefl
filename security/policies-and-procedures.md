# Policies and Procedures

Currently the team is working to finalize this work and have it completed for the 1.8 Release and for the transition to the CNCF.
These policies and procedures will be based of the [Kubernetes Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/security/)
We are working on updating and editing these policies and procedures for the Kubeflow Community.  Our very **rough DRAFT and working docs** can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sjWa0G2UqdsP1QROYVEl9iQR6v1x8HD7-F4TQo7lV6M/edit?usp=sharing)

## The first iteration of the Kubeflow Security Policies and Procedures are as follows*:

*Please note we will continue to iterate on this with each release and as we get commitments from our distributions and volunteers from each of the Kubeflow components and working groups (WG). As the team grows we will work to set up roles and responsibilities to bring us closer in line with the Kubernetes policies and procedures.* 

The Kubeflow Security team (listed below as “we”) will take a multi-level, transparent approach to the security of Kubeflow (product/code). At this time we will base this effort to align with each release.  As noted above as we get more volunteers to help with these efforts we will continue to iterate on the cadence.  

1. We will encourage Kubeflow users to open issues with the respective WG that the vulnerability was found and tag it with the “security” tag. If they don’t know how to do that or don’t feel comfortable doing so, they can also contact us via our #security slack channel.  And if a private mailing list/group is needed we will set that up. 
2. We will be working with the WG leads to give updates on any security related issues. 
3. We will go through all issues tagged as “security” and review bi-weekly. 
4. We use the results from the 1.7 Release scans and work to break these out into their respective WGs and reach out those leads (as noted in #2 above)
