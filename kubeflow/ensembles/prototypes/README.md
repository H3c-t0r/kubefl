## Overview

### Ensembles / Compositions

Kubeflow's use of ksonnet to register and generate components enables a declarative framework 
where the ensemble of components is encompassed within a namespace. 
This ensemble is used to provide a wide range of compositions.
Users create isolated namespaces where a specific composition meets their required functionality.
