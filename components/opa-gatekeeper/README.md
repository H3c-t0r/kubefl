# Gatekeeper and Kubeflow

[Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) is a policy controller for Kubernetes that enforces CRD-based access control policies.
In Kubeflow, we use Gatekeeper to restrict controllers to their own namespaces. The details can be found [here](https://bit.ly/2yJeU5u).
